<!DOCTYPE html> <!--this declares the document to be interpreted using the html standard-->
<html> <!--the code for the entire page appears within the html tag. this is rendered top to bottom by the browser-->
<head> <!--the head tag contains items that describe the content of the page (metadata about the main content), like what character encoding should the browser use-->
	<meta charset="utf-8"> <!--a meta tag that specifies the character set encoding of the web page-->
	<title>Learning HTML</title> <!--a required meta tag. provides the browser tab label-->
</head>
<body> <!--the root of all content that is visible to the user-->
<h1>"&lt;!doctype html&gt;" signifies that this page follows the html standard<br>
this is a section in the page body<br>
sublime is nice because when you type the first characters of a closing tag i.e. &lt;/<br>
it automatically fills in the correct closing tag value<br>
note that in order to get &lt; to show up i had to use the character string "&" "l" "t" ";"<br>
of course these 4 characters are together with no spaces to make up an html 'entity'<br>
one can get quite lost reading stack overflow, consider htmlspecialchars...for example<br>
